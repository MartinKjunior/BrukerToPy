Scripts I've used during my PhD that may be useful to others.

Currently supports:
 1. Loading a batch of raw bruker data into niftis and the metadata into python dictionaries.
 2. Providing an object-oriented iterface for handling the loaded data.
 3. Running a DTI processing pipeline on the loaded dataset.

My interests are in preclinical MRI (using Bruker scanner), phase-contrast MRI,
DCE MRI, image processing.
